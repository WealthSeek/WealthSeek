- 👋 Hi, I am @WealthSeek
- 👀 I’m interested in creating community through collaboration and giving.
- 💞️ I’m looking to support the Shiden network by nominating dapps that are valuable because they are useful.
- WealthSeek Fellowship controls about 1% of the circulating Shiden tokens @ XJeJw9E6qxwPNfUYV97582tD24kgFk41LhREM9AD2EGrhDQ
- These tokens will be staked in the Shiden Dapp staking program.
- The staking rewards will go to Wealth Seekers that are actively creating useful applications.
- WealthSeek prefers non-financial dapps that do not require their own token.
- 📫 Reach me at bitcoinisbest@outlook.com
